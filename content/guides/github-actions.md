## Learning path

I recommend the book "GitHub Actions : a practical guide" (exists in [english](https://www.amazon.com/GitHub-Actions-practical-Louis-Guillaume-MORAND-ebook/dp/B09D3Z3Y48) or [french](https://www.amazon.fr/GitHub-Actions-pratique-Louis-Guillaume-MORAND/dp/2957832941/)). As an alternative, there is a [Microsoft Learn path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/automate-workflow-github-actions/) but it does **not** cover everything such as authoring custom GitHub Actions.

In addition, I recommend [this module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/manage-github-actions-enterprise/introduction) which is not in the learning path but present in the exam.

## Additional Topics

- **Matrix Builds**: Learn how to test across multiple environments using matrix strategies.
- **Artifacts**: Understand how to upload and download artifacts between jobs.
- **Environment Protections**: Configure rules like required reviewers and wait timers for secure deployments.
